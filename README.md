This project was a school assigment that I worked on with my team. The project lasted for about one month, where we went through all the stages of developing an application. Thorough documentation can be found on the WIKI (located on gitlab repo). 

_Note, the database used for this project has been removed or changed, therefore it is not possible to log in or register a user, but the launcher can be run. Screenshots of the application can be find in the user manual in the WIKI._
